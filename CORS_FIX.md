# CORS Error Fix

## Problem
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://edurag-retrieval-augmented-educational.onrender.com/upload' 
from origin 'https://edu-rag-retrieval-augmented-educati.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause
The CORS configuration was too restrictive and didn't properly handle wildcard origins.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ **Simplified CORS Configuration**
```python
# OLD: Complex configuration with specific origins
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "https://*.vercel.app",
    "https://*.onrender.com",
    "*"
],

# NEW: Simple wildcard for all origins
allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins for development
```

## Why This Works

1. **`allow_origins=["*"]`** - Allows requests from any origin
2. **`allow_credentials=True`** - Allows cookies/auth headers
3. **`allow_methods=["*"]`** - Allows all HTTP methods
4. **`allow_headers=["*"]`** - Allows all request headers

## Security Note

This configuration allows all origins, which is fine for:
- ✅ **Development** - Easy testing
- ✅ **Public APIs** - Open access
- ✅ **Demo applications** - No restrictions

For production, you might want to restrict to specific domains:
```python
allow_origins=[
    "https://your-frontend-domain.com",
    "https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app"
]
```

## Testing

### Before Fix:
- ❌ CORS error in browser console
- ❌ Upload requests blocked
- ❌ Frontend can't communicate with backend

### After Fix:
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ Upload requests work
- ✅ Frontend communicates with backend
- ✅ All API endpoints accessible

## Expected Result
✅ Frontend can upload files to backend
✅ No more CORS policy errors
✅ Chat functionality works
✅ All API endpoints accessible from Vercel frontend
