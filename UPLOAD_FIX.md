# File Upload Fix - The Real Issue

## Problem
The frontend was trying to upload to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (localhost) instead of the deployed Render backend.

## Root Cause
```javascript
// OLD: Wrong API URL for production
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:8000';

// NEW: Correct Render backend URL
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'https://edurag-retrieval-augmented-educational.onrender.com';
```

## Why This Was the Issue

1. **Frontend on Vercel**: `https://edu-rag-retrieval-augmented-educati.vercel.app`
2. **Backend on Render**: `https://edurag-retrieval-augmented-educational.onrender.com`
3. **Frontend was calling**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload` (localhost - doesn't exist in production)
4. **Should be calling**: `https://edurag-retrieval-augmented-educational.onrender.com/upload`

## The Fix

### ✅ **Updated API_BASE_URL**
```javascript
// Now points to the correct Render backend
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://edurag-retrieval-augmented-educational.onrender.com';
```

## What This Fixes

1. **✅ File Upload**: Frontend can now reach the backend
2. **✅ Health Check**: Status checks work
3. **✅ Chat**: After upload, chat will work
4. **✅ All API Calls**: Everything connects properly

## Testing

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Frontend calls `http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload` (localhost)
- ❌ Upload fails with network error
- ❌ No connection to backend

### After Fix:
- ✅ Frontend calls `https://edurag-retrieval-augmented-educational.onrender.com/upload`
- ✅ Upload works properly
- ✅ Backend processes files
- ✅ Chat becomes available

## Expected Result
✅ File upload works from Vercel frontend to Render backend
✅ No more network errors
✅ Documents get processed and embeddings created
✅ Chat functionality works after upload
