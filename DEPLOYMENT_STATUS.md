# Deployment Status Check

## ✅ Backend Status: WORKING PERFECTLY
- **Health check**: ✅ 200 OK
- **CORS headers**: ✅ All present and correct
- **Origin allowed**: ✅ `https://edu-rag-retrieval-augmented-educati.vercel.app`
- **Methods allowed**: ✅ POST, GET, etc.
- **Credentials**: ✅ Allowed

## 🔍 The Real Issue
The backend is working perfectly. The CORS error you're seeing is likely due to:

### 1. **Frontend Not Redeployed**
The frontend change (new API URL) needs to be deployed to Vercel:
```bash
# You need to commit and push the frontend changes
git add frontend/src/App.js
git commit -m "Fix API URL for production"
git push
```

### 2. **Browser Cache**
The browser is still using the old cached CORS error. Try:
- **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- **Clear browser cache**
- **Open in incognito/private mode**

### 3. **Vercel Deployment**
Check if the frontend has been redeployed with the new API URL:
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Check if the latest commit is deployed
- The API_BASE_URL should now be: `https://edurag-retrieval-augmented-educational.onrender.com`

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Commit and push** the frontend changes
2. **Wait for Vercel deployment** to complete
3. **Hard refresh** the frontend
4. **Test file upload** again

## Expected Result
✅ Frontend calls correct backend URL
✅ CORS headers are present (we confirmed this)
✅ File upload works
✅ Chat becomes available
